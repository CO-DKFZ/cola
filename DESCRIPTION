Description: Subgroup classification is a basic task in genomic data analysis, 
  especially for gene expression data and methylation data. It can predict novel 
  subgroups when there is nothing known about the data or it can test consistency 
  between predicted subgrups with known annotations. The cola package provides 
  a general framework for subgroup classification by consensus clustering. 
  It has following functionalities: 1. it tests multiple methods simultaneously; 
  2. it provides rich visualizations for the stability of subgrouping; 3. it 
  finds subgroups even the difference between subgroups are subtile; 4. it can 
  find subgroups in a hierarchical manner.
